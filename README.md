- 👋 Hi, I’m Hong Liu, a software developer who has been enjoying coding since the Intel 8086/MSDOS 5 time -- am not looking that old though😄
- 👀 I've been working on Kubernetes (EKS, GCP and Azure AKS) and AI/LLM related devops and software testing in recent years.
- 🌱 While my personal interests have been laying on system internals for both Windows and Linux, mainly on the user space -- for example debugging and software runtime analysis, reversing, binary instrumentation such as customized [Dynamorio](https://dynamorio.org/) and software fuzzing, e.g. was in the first few groups of internal users of [Microsoft's Detours](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours) back in 2005, etc. A little bit on kernel space and device drivers, mainly on file systems, disk IO and caching.
- 💞️ Unfortunately I'm not a big fan of Apple and Mach-O (though I've been using work-related Mac a lot in recent years), as I only have 24 hours a day, same like you 😄
- 📫 How to reach me ...?
- 😄 Pronouns: ...?
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been a Windows guy, while got my first Linux job back in 2001, and it was on writing a NVRAM driver on Linux kernel 2.4 for a medical device. Got my first Java job back in 2015 when joining Arxan, and it was on Java bytecode and Dex obfuscation, and playing games with JVM and Android's Dalvik, anti reversing and temptation etc. Was lucky to join Cisco's OutShift group a few years ago, and happy to learn that I'm comfortable with [bash scripting](https://github.com/bookworm6914/public-shared/tree/main/mac_linux) as well while fighting with K8s and AI agents 😄
- Continue enjoying the time with the computer 😄
